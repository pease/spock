Getting Started
===============

It's really easy to get started with Spock. This section shows you how.

Spock Web Console
-----------------

`Spock Web Console`_ is a website that allows you to instantly view, edit, run, and even publish Spock specifications. It is the perfect place to toy around with Spock without making any commitments. So why not run `Hello, Spock!`_ right now?

Spock Example Project
---------------------

To try Spock on your own computer, download and unzip the Example Project (`download link`_). It comes with fully working Ant, Gradle, and Maven builds that require no further setup. The Gradle build even bootstraps Gradle itself and gets you up and running in Eclipse or IDEA with a single command. See the README for detailed instructions.
